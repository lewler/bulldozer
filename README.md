# Bulldozer

Bulldozer is a script designed to automate the process of downloading, organizing, analyzing, and creating torrents for podcasts. It's highly customizable, as pretty much everything you might be interested in changing is defined in the configuration file.

## Features

- Download podcast episodes using RSS feeds
- Check for duplicate episodes using tracker API
- Organize and analyze downloaded files
- Generate reports based on the downloaded content
- Data fetching from the Podchaser and Podcastindex API
- Data fetching from Podnews
- Automatic RSS censoring for matching premium sources
- Optional local database with metadata for improved flexibility
- Option to split active podcasts on current year (database required)
- Partial download of feed using --match-titles
- Torrent file creation with piece size calculation

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.0+
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- mktorrent
- ffmpeg

### Optional Requirements
- mediainfo

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:lewler/bulldozer.git
    cd bulldozer
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install additional dependencies:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install libwebp-dev libavif-dev
    ```

4. Install podcast-dl:
    ```sh
    curl -L "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/lightpohl/podcast-dl/releases/latest | yq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | test("linux-x64$")) | .browser_download_url')" -o ~/.local/bin/podcast-dl && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/podcast-dl
    ```

5. Create your own config file, and add the things you need to override:
    ```sh
    touch config.yaml
    ```

6. If you want to use the Podchaser API you will need a token, which is free up to 25k points per month.

## Configuration

Edit the `config.yaml` file to set up your preferences and API keys. The configuration file includes pretty much all settings that are needed to customize the behavior of the script. The settings most users need to change are at the top of the configuration file. The file has comments, and it's hopefully easy enough to understand what everything does.

Note that you do not need to copy the entire file, and you do not need to add values that you don't need to change. This approach means less work when new things are added to `config.default.yaml`.

## Upgrading

Upgrading should be fairly simple, but if you're jumping versions it might get messy. In that case, do a fresh install and copy your settings over. To upgrade do the following:

1. Update the codebase
    ```sh
    git pull
    ````

2. Make sure requirements are up-to-date
    ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
    ```

3. Run the config checker to see if your config is outdated
    ```sh
    python bulldozer --check-config
    ```
    The config checker will let you know if there are settings in your config that are outdated (ie, the don't exist in the default config).


## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Run the script using the command line interface:

```sh
python bulldozer <input>
```
`<input>`: RSS feed URL, directory path, local RSS file path, or name to dupecheck.

Note that if your on Linux, you should be able to run the script in this way:
```sh
chmod +x bulldozer
./bulldozer <input>
```

### Options
- `--censor-rss`: Make sure the RSS feed is censored.
- `--report-only`: Only check the files.
- `--download-only`: Only downloads the files.
- `--refresh`: Don't use the data in the database.
- `--check-files`: Only check the files.
- `--dupecheck`: Search the API for <input>.
- `--make-torrent`: Only create a torrent file.
- `--check-config`: Check if user config is valid.
- `--log-level`: Set the logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
- `--search-term`: Use <input> as search term instead of podcast name.
- `--name`: Use <input> as the podcast name.
- `--match-titles`: Will only keep episodes matching <input> in the feed.
- `--after`: Will only keep episodes released after <input> in the feed (YYYY-MM-DD).
- `--before`: Will only keep episodes released before <input> in the feed (YYYY-MM-DD).
- `--latest-episode-only`: Will only keep the newest episode in the feed.
- `--threads`: Overrides the setting in config.yaml for the number of threads podcast-dl uses.

## Running With Docker

Docker should allow you to run bulldozer on mac or without installing all the native dependencies. This is a quick guide assuming you're new to docker. 

To get started, first install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

To run interactively, you'll want to construct a command like this: 

```
docker run --pull always -it --rm -v ./config.yaml:/usr/bulldozer/config.yaml -v ~/temp_podcasts/:/output/podcasts/ ghcr.io/lewler/bulldozer:main /bin/bash
```
Explanation: 
- [`--pull always`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#pull) tries to pull updates to the image. 
- `-it` and `/bin/bash` in the command drop you into a shell inside the container. This is useful because bulldozer requires interaction. If you leave these off, the default command will validate your config. 
- [`--rm`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#rm) automatically cleans up the container when it exits. This is a good default or docker has a habit of filling up your hard drive.
- [`-v`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#volume) mounts the volume following the pattern `/path/on/your/computer/:/path/on/container/`.
    - `/path/to/config.yaml:/usr/bulldozer/config.yaml` is required in order to pass your local bulldozer config.
    - `~/temp_podcasts/:/output/podcasts/` can be whatever you want. Note: the path you specify in your config is the path in the container not the host!
- `ghcr.io/lewler/bulldozer:main` is the name for the image. `main` will automatically update when new versions are pushed to the main branch on github. The short commit sha should also work as a tag.

For Mac users: You can probably get it to run with `--platform linux/x86_64` in the `docker run` command using docker desktop for mac (I tested it once).
